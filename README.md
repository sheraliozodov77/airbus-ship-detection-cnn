# Airbus Ship Detection CNN

This repository presents a full deep learning pipeline for the [Airbus Ship Detection Challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/airbus-ship-detection), hosted on Kaggle. The goal is to accurately detect ships in satellite imagery using modern CNN-based segmentation architectures.

**Project Author:** Sherali Ozodov  
**Instructor:** Jason Pacheco  
**Course:** CSC 480 ‚Äì Principles of Machine Learning  
**University of Arizona**

## Project Summary

The task involves identifying all ships in satellite images‚Äîeven under clouds, haze, or varied sea conditions. We approach this as a **supervised segmentation problem** and explore multiple deep learning models:

- **ResUNet** ‚Äì a residual version of U-Net with skip connections
- **U-Net++** ‚Äì a nested U-Net architecture for better multi-scale feature fusion
- **Attention U-Net** ‚Äì integrates attention gates to focus on ship-relevant regions

Each model was trained on a processed version of the dataset using TFRecords for performance and reproducibility.

## Competition Details

- **Organizer**: Airbus via Kaggle
- **Dataset**: Satellite images with masks provided via Run-Length Encoding (RLE)
- **Evaluation Metric**: Average **F2 Score** over IoU thresholds `0.5 ‚Üí 0.95`
- **Submission Format**: RLE masks in CSV

## What This Repository Covers

### Preprocessing & TFRecord Generation
- Converts RLE masks into binary masks
- Applies augmentations with `Albumentations`
- Serializes data into efficient `TFRecord` shards

### Model Architectures
- Lightweight and standard versions of:
  - `ResUNet`
  - `U-Net++`
  - `Attention U-Net`

### Training Pipeline
- Mixed precision for speed
- Combo loss: Dice + Focal Tversky
- ModelCheckpoint, EarlyStopping, ReduceLRO callbacks
- Loss and accuracy visualizations

### Evaluation & Submission
- Runs predictions on test set
- Converts masks to RLE
- Saves `submission.csv`
- Generates side-by-side image + predicted mask visualizations

## Results & Highlights

Below is a summary of validation performance and official Kaggle leaderboard scores for the three architectures evaluated, along with the final ensemble submission:

| Model            | Val Dice | Val IoU | LB Public | LB Private |
|------------------|----------|---------|-----------|------------|
| ResUNet          | ~0.64    | ~0.50   | 0.517     | 0.755 ‚úÖ    |
| U-Net++          | ~0.66    | ~0.52   | 0.477     | 0.715      |
| Attention U-Net  | ~0.63    | ~0.49   | 0.505     | 0.728      |
| **Ensemble (Weighted)** | ‚Äî        | ‚Äî       | **0.51299** | **0.75679 üèÜ** |

- ‚úÖ **ResUNet** performed best among individual models on the private leaderboard.
- **U-Net++** had strong validation metrics but did not generalize as well to the leaderboard.
- **Attention U-Net** showed stable performance across both public and private scores.
- üèÜ The **ensemble model**, using weighted predictions (50% ResUNet, 30% Attention U-Net, 20% U-Net++), **achieved the highest private score**, making it the most reliable for final submission.
